The Frequency Table
=======================================
The frequency table is the standard format used in many drivers. It can be found with the following commands:

		ADD	A,A			;Use the note number to index
		ADD	A,LOW(TblMzFrq)	;into a table of frequency
		LD	L,A			;values.
		LD	A,HIGH(TblMzFrq)
		ADC	0
		LD	H,A

Which equals the following in hex:
87 C6 ?? 6F 3E ?? CE 00 67

Drum Table Values
=======================================
Imediately following is a table of drum values. It can be found with the following commands:
		LD	A,[DE]			;Get drum number.
		INC	DE			;

		ADD	A,A			;Use it as an index into the drum
		ADD	A,LOW(TblMzDrum)	;table.
		LD	L,A			;
		LD	A,0			;
		ADC	A,HIGH(TblMzDrum);
		LD	H,A			;

		PUSH	DE

		LD	A,[HLI]			;Get the address of the drum.
		LD	D,[HL]			;
		LD	E,A			;

Song Pattern Table
=======================================
The song pattern table is comprised of series of four 16-bit values specifying is found with the following commands:
		LD	L,A			;Multiply by 8 to get offset.
		LD	H,0			;
		ADD	HL,HL			;
		ADD	HL,HL			;
		ADD	HL,HL			;

		LD	A,L			;Use as index into MZ_TUNE_TABLE.
		ADD	A,LOW(TblMzTune)	;
		LD	E,A			;
		LD	A,H			;
		ADC	A,HIGH(TblMzTune)	;

add hl, de
ld a, l
add a, high(SongList)
ld e, a
ld a, h
adc a, low(SongList)

Song Pattern (1):
(16-bit values) pointing to each 16-byte pattern, ending with FFFF xxxx (loop point)
